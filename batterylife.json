Here are few things I have found after 5 days of usage:Pros:1. Great Camera - The camera is awesome in this phone. I have attached few pics taken from this phone and they look great. The color reproduction is not exactly 100 percent but very close. The images turn out a little bit more colorful than they actually are but they look really good. Selfies in portrait mode are very good and even without the portrait mode they look great. The profession mode is wonderful if you can take some time learning how to use it. The pic of the mango that I have posted was taken in the professional mode. The HDR mode produces good evenly lit pictures - the pic of pink flowers against the sky background and the night mode is a great add on. Videos in 4k 60fps are stunning. This in fact is one of the very few phones out there which can record 4k at 60fps which is usually something that most pricey flagship phones are capable of. There is one thing to be noted here though that the video length cannot be more than 5 minutes. I purchased this phone for the camera and it has not disappointed me ever.2. Good Battery life - With some 4 hours of music listening, 1 hour of browsing and youtube videos, the phone drains by around 70% in 14 hours. The charging is fast.3. Speed - The Phone is very responsive and smooth. Haven't played games yet on it but am sure the phone would be able to handle that with ease. It feels like a fast phone.4. Permium feel - The phone is a little heavier than other phones of almost the same size so feels solid and premium. While some people might feel the lighter the phone is the better it is, it's my personal opinion that a slightly heavier phone feels good.5. Screen - The screen is bright and has stunning clarity.Cons:1. The in-screen fingerprint sensor - This is kind of the weakest link. The finger print sensor is slow. It feels slower than some of the sub 20000 phones out there. Of course this kind of comparison is like apples and oranges because this is an in-screen sensor and I am comparing it with the sensors at the back but still. It feels slow. The face recognition though is zippy and very fast.2. No provision for 3.55 mm jack. So you cannot listen to songs while charging the phone(Unless you have bluetooth headphones of course)Apart from these two things the phone is pretty much complete and at the price at which it is available now, definitely worth the money.

Go for it guys. :)  ", "review_date": "1 April 2019", "review_text": "Before I write something about the phone or its specs, I would like to say I keep changing smartphone and usually I buy in range of 10K-15K however, since last 1 year no smartphone was fascinating me apart from POCO F1 but already being a MI user ( 6 MI phones used since last 5 years) and few cousins already owning it,  It didn't allow me to buy same. But, I was more concern with the price and then I started searching a lot about all the latest smartphone who has Snapdragon 845 SOC I ended up my search on One Plus 6T.Today, I'm happy enough to share this review after using the device for 3 months. All I would say if you have a budget of 30K then spend some more and go for One Plus 6T as of now.Now Lets talk about pros and cons:Pros:Great battery life With super fast chargingAmazing performance and smart boost featurePremium design with shining glassImpressive rear and front camera with good quality low light capturingIn display fingerprint scanner is really fast and I Love the cosmos effectNo heating at all, I m a pubg lover too.Cons:No headphone jack but you'll get a converter, I wished they could provide ear plug directly instead of converter.No notification LED lightsNo microSD card slot but Its okay I m not much storage guy 128GB is more than enough for me.The major one for me atleast, PRICE I know its a flagship device but I want this at 30KRating as per the usage of last 3 months so far.Weight: 9/10OS: 9/10Screen quality: 9/10CPU: 10/10Performance: 10/10Storage: 10/10 (113 gb almost)Battery: 9/10Rear camera: 9/10Front camera: 8/10In display fingerprint scanner: 9/10Face unlock: 8/10Thanks.

I have owned oneplus X and then oneplus 3 and now oneplus 6t and believe me there is no match to this machine in this price bracket. It feels like all other brands are cheating Us by selling overpriced similar phones. Zaruri nahi achi cheez mehngi hi ho. Everything is great about this phone. Superb screen, awsome sound quality, awsome camera, great battery life, looks premium , excellent network reception, superb sound quality of both mic and ear piece and speaker, no heating issues, excellent sunlight visibility of screen, great oneplus operating system near stock android ROM experience, regular software updates are being provided, dual 4g volte i.e we can use 2 4g volte sims side by side now. I use airtel and jio sims and both work great parallely. Good quality of back cover is provided with phone in box, usb type c to 3.5mm jack converter is included in box. Dash charger is great as ever. No earphones included in box. Superb quality of usb type c cable. Bought it in first opening sale. Just go for it, no 2nd thaughts. This is best ever mobilephone by oneplus. This is not a paid review so Pls vote the review as helpful if I help you in choosing your product.
