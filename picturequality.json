Amazing performance. Lightning fast unlock by face or fingerprint. Frequent upgrades from OnePlus. The camera quality is amazing. And the water drop notch is simply so cool and classy. I love the weight/handling/performance of this phone. The battery definitely lasts one whole day after a partial charge. It takes around one hour atleast to charge fully but that is satisfactory given that I use it heavily for gaming etc during the day and also for recording my meetings at working and blackboard pictures. Recently ai have also been using Google translate instant on images and that works fabulously with this device.Oh and the best part! I am glad I did not wait for OnePlus 7.

The replacement unit was good. Phone was compared with iphone 6s and Honor 10. In all aspects it is better than iPhone 6s and even iphone 8 in some aspects but speed wise it was same as Honor 10. The image quality is same as on the honor 10 in some cases honor 10 images were better. Video picture quality i felt was better on H10 but the overall stabilisation is much better on Oneplus 6t. Where it beats the h10 is the selfie camera. Battery life slightly less than H10 due to screen size. Screen quality is only slightly better than H10. If this helps.

But overall its good! Selfie doesnt click good images sometimes! Especially during low light! Images comes faded , thats the bad remark i have over selfie!! In open light selfies are good !!Sound quality is ok!! If u r a gamer! Then u might close the outlet of single speaker which restricts the flow of sound!!Battery life is awsome! No doubt!!So overall if you ask me to rate i would give 4 stars!!
