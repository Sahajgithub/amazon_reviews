0,"Phone doesn't even complete the setup and installation. Gets stuck after putting in email ID's, face and fingerprint recognition. I had lots of things to say about One Plus6T and Amazon but they disallowed my previous review. I raised a return request - which is subject to a technician visit and evaluation - post which i will only get a replacement ( not a refund - even if i no longer want this product). Will update this review post the technician visit.  ",negative,0,0,0,1,0

27,Performance is top-notch..great specs. Great RAM management and smooth gaming. The OIS was found not performing upto the mark. But considering the price its not much of a worry. The fingerprint scanner also get mushy sometimes but i never really had the needed for it cuz face recognition does a very good job and is blazing fast.  Packaging was good and delivery was right on time. Camera may not be flagship level. But it can be improved alot by sideloading GCam port. So its not much of a big deal.  The display may tend to get a bit annoying in direct sunlight .but indoor it does a great job.  ,positive,0,0,0,1,1

Did not expect this type of quality from OnePlus from this range of budget , those who are reading this review , I really suggest you to buy this product it is simply awesome....The back side for mirror black is simply classy and you need to put a nice case for this *original OnePlus case is recommended to make sure it is comfy inside . The only major issue for me is delivery part was delayed . Mine is the 8 gigs ram & 128 gigs version... I prebooked this product and was the first one to pay in Amazon . 4K video quality is simply cool and the one and only outstanding camera feature is the NIGHTS CAPE MODE , the one and only phone with this option , low light photos is mind blowing and the in display fingerprint sensor and face id is really very quick and responsive (<0.2secs) .

49,Everything about this phone is a delight. Amazing performance. Lightning fast unlock by face or fingerprint. Frequent upgrades from OnePlus. The camera quality is amazing. And the water drop notch is simply so cool and classy. I love the weight/handling/performance of this phone. The battery definitely lasts one whole day after a partial charge. It takes around one hour atleast to charge fully but that is satisfactory given that I use it heavily for gaming etc during the day and also for recording my meetings at working and blackboard pictures. Recently ai have also been using Google translate instant on images and that works fabulously with this device.Oh and the best part! I am glad I did not wait for OnePlus 7. The pop up selfie camera is definitely not something I want compared to this amazing water drop notch design  ,positive,1,0,0,1,1
