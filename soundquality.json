But overall its good! Selfie doesnt click good images sometimes! Especially during low light! Images comes faded , thats the bad remark i have over selfie!! In open light selfies are good !!Sound quality is ok!! If u r a gamer! Then u might close the outlet of single speaker which restricts the flow of sound!!Battery life is awsome! No doubt!!So overall if you ask me to rate i would give 4 stars!!
