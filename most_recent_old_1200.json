This is nice phone but has major drawbacks.The camera that they advertise for the depth effect doesn't seems to work. The camera crashes everytime when I try to click pictures in depth mode.Also its not even 6 months from the date of purchase, and the phone is not durable at all.Glass got shattered when it fell.There must be some durability when they say gorilla glass 6 and they charge you huge amount for the phone; and even accessories.I have really had not so good experience about oneplus 6t.
