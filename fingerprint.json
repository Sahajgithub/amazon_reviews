", "review_date": "8 April 2019", "review_text": "Overall: 8/10:A fantastic package at good value. 6T McLaren is'nt much different from the standard 6T except for the RAM and some minor cosmetic changes. But for a long time fan of the Silver Arrows from Mika Hakkinen's time, a small increase in price was worth it. Call me sentimental! :)Unboxing & contents: 8/10One of the coolest unboxing experiences. The McLaren box is very premium and the booklet starts with giving you a brief glimpse into the history of the brand and some cool pictures from the archives. It is an homage to Bruce McLaren to be honest. The Speed Mark (real Carbon Fire cutout of the McLaren logo) encased in acrylic is pretty good and can serve as a cool table top accessory or paper weight. If not for much it can be a good ice breaker for visitors to your home / office. The Charger and Cable are also customized for the McLaren edition. The Soft PU case is simple black and fits snugly. There was a missed opportunity to throw in some colour for the McLaren edition. All else is pretty much standard. Providing only a USB-C to 3.5 converter is a bummer. For the flagship offering at over 50K, throwing in a Bullet Earphone should have been standard.First Impressions: 9/10The device is actually pretty impressive looking. Especially the orange accents at the Bezel on the back. When you change the angle under light, it almost looks like there are LEDs inside. It looks premium for sure though an actual Carbon Fibre body would have been awesome! Be warned though that the surface is a fingerprint magnet and not easy to wipe off unless you use a good cleaning spray. The Waterdrop notch is barely noticeable and is not much of an issue. The colours are vibrant and while setting up you can choose a profile that suits your taste.Setup: 8/10The SIM Card tray is a standard two Nano-SIM one. No SD Card support still! But with 240 GB usable memory, not much of an issue to be honest. I used the OnePlus switch app to transfer my apps, data and settings. The transition was hassle free and took all of 15 minutes. Most apps worked immediately but a few needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled as they were acting up. I gave it a point less as I think the OnePlus Switch app should be integrated at the setup stage instead of making a new user download it. The phone heats up considerably but it was fine after the initial 30 minutes.Battery: 7/10The unit came with 50% power out of the box and it took me a good 30 minutes to get it to 75% despite using the Warp Charge @ 30W. Probably it was due to the fact that close to 100 apps were being downloaded while it was charging. I will check the charging performance over the next few weeks and update review if required.Performance: 9/10Gaming: Initial performance on gaming is very very good (Asphalt 9 Legends and Real Racing 3). Zero lag and super smooth rendering.  Bloons TD6 is a very resource hungry at lategame levels and the 6T McLaren  made short work of it.Display: The display is really mind-blowing. Video on Youtube and other streaming apps was super smooth and brilliant to look at. One cool feature is that you can pinch zoom the content to include / exclude the waterdrop notch for front camera.  Adaptive brightness is annoying at times and I had to turn it off while playing the racing games.Camera: Have not tested the Camera performance yet. Especially the 4K 60 FPS option. Will do it soon and update the review.Hope this helps!

Here are few things I have found after 5 days of usage:Pros:1. Great Camera - The camera is awesome in this phone. I have attached few pics taken from this phone and they look great. The color reproduction is not exactly 100 percent but very close. The images turn out a little bit more colorful than they actually are but they look really good. Selfies in portrait mode are very good and even without the portrait mode they look great. The profession mode is wonderful if you can take some time learning how to use it. The pic of the mango that I have posted was taken in the professional mode. The HDR mode produces good evenly lit pictures - the pic of pink flowers against the sky background and the night mode is a great add on. Videos in 4k 60fps are stunning. This in fact is one of the very few phones out there which can record 4k at 60fps which is usually something that most pricey flagship phones are capable of. There is one thing to be noted here though that the video length cannot be more than 5 minutes. I purchased this phone for the camera and it has not disappointed me ever.2. Good Battery life - With some 4 hours of music listening, 1 hour of browsing and youtube videos, the phone drains by around 70% in 14 hours. The charging is fast.3. Speed - The Phone is very responsive and smooth. Haven't played games yet on it but am sure the phone would be able to handle that with ease. It feels like a fast phone.4. Permium feel - The phone is a little heavier than other phones of almost the same size so feels solid and premium. While some people might feel the lighter the phone is the better it is, it's my personal opinion that a slightly heavier phone feels good.5. Screen - The screen is bright and has stunning clarity.Cons:1. The in-screen fingerprint sensor - This is kind of the weakest link. The finger print sensor is slow. It feels slower than some of the sub 20000 phones out there. Of course this kind of comparison is like apples and oranges because this is an in-screen sensor and I am comparing it with the sensors at the back but still. It feels slow. The face recognition though is zippy and very fast.2. No provision for 3.55 mm jack. So you cannot listen to songs while charging the phone(Unless you have bluetooth headphones of course)Apart from these two things the phone is pretty much complete and at the price at which it is available now, definitely worth the money.

But, I was more concern with the price and then I started searching a lot about all the latest smartphone who has Snapdragon 845 SOC I ended up my search on One Plus 6T.Today, I'm happy enough to share this review after using the device for 3 months. All I would say if you have a budget of 30K then spend some more and go for One Plus 6T as of now.Now Lets talk about pros and cons:Pros:Great battery life With super fast chargingAmazing performance and smart boost featurePremium design with shining glassImpressive rear and front camera with good quality low light capturingIn display fingerprint scanner is really fast and I Love the cosmos effectNo heating at all, I m a pubg lover too.Cons:No headphone jack but you'll get a converter, I wished they could provide ear plug directly instead of converter.No notification LED lightsNo microSD card slot but Its okay I m not much storage guy 128GB is more than enough for me.The major one for me atleast, PRICE I know its a flagship device but I want this at 30KRating as per the usage of last 3 months so far.Weight: 9/10OS: 9/10Screen quality: 9/10CPU: 10/10Performance: 10/10Storage: 10/10 (113 gb almost)Battery: 9/10Rear camera: 9/10Front camera: 8/10In display fingerprint scanner: 9/10Face unlock: 8/10Thanks.

After using this i am surprised with the differences. Oneplus 6T is far far far better in every field except in looks becausse of S9 curved display.Battery - 7 hrs SOT with 24 hrs idle time.Camera - Best in class. i observed S9 captured bit better in low light, because of f1.6 aperture, oneplus 6t is not far behind. Thanks to night mode.bokeh/portrait mode is exceptionnaly better than s9 and same with Day light.Display - S9 has better display but u cant use that otherwise your battery wont even last for 3 hours. Oneplus 6T has Amoled display which is enough for me.Indisplay Fingerprint - Using first time in any mobile, i liked it . response time is few micro seconds more than traditional finger print scanner. only few ms.Face Recognition - Great, even in full dark. most of the time u wont even see the lock screen as soon as u press the lock button it opens. In full dark, it uses screen light to recognize the face.Processer and performance - Best in class. i used to play pubg in high settings without any heating issue. All games runs very smooth. i tried GTA, asphalt, need for speed NL, etc.Gesture support is great after update. Its very fast and user friendly.Sound - Single speaker, Speaker sound is OK, not so great. S9 has better speaker sound than this.
